## Land acknowledgement {background-image=assets/img/land_ack.jpg background-size=cover background-opacity="0.4"}

**I would like to acknowledge that I work on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations.**

*Traditional*: Traditionally used and/or occupied by Musqueam people

*Ancestral*: Recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation

*Unceded*: Refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement

## Objective

- Improve diagnosis using multimodal data

- Can we tell long term outcome of rejection?

## Improve diagnosis using mulitmodal data

- Add proposal fig of slide

## Can we tell long term outcome of rejection

## What method to apply

- Need to know which method is most suitable to apply on this
- Which there really isnt any after the pipeline run



## MESSI pipeline

- We created a workflow pipeline [*Multimodal Experiments with SyStematic Interrogation using nextflow*]{.secondary}
- Built with Nextflow [@di2017nextflow], Singularity [@kurtzer2017singularity]

## MESSI pipeline

## Standardized data preprocessing

![](assets/img/overview_fig/overview_upper_panel.png){fig-align="center"}


- Currently handles both R and Python --> could extend to more
- Data flows in there , handles N different datasets
- Important model selection prior to evaluation


## Flexible method evaluation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

![](assets/img/overview_fig/overview_mid_panel.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

- Each method is an isolated workflow (dash box)
- Each method internally runs evaluation in parallel
- Each result is saved separately ...
- Easily extended to other tasks not just CV
- On / Off to run interested methods only

## Summarized reports of metrics performances

![](assets/img/overview_fig/overview_bottom_panel.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}


- "Recursively" collects output from each method including versions
- Summarizes metrics for downstream analysis
- Provides rich report of computational resource usages

## Discussion & Future directions {.smaller}

- "**No method works universally well on all datasets**"
- Classic statistical methods still work, and sometimes even better than deep learning (DL)
- Pipeline proves way to [reproducibly]{.tertiary} explore, benchmark different aspects of integration methods
  - Resumable
  - Parallel to compute as many resources as allowed at the same time
  - Ease burden of [setting up environment]{.secondary}

- Need to add more methods and datasets
  - Especially DL models are more popular now
  - Explore if any dataset could have relation to another despite different disease/condition
