## Land acknowledgement {background-image=assets/img/land_ack.jpg background-size=cover background-opacity="0.4"}

**I would like to acknowledge that I work on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations.**

*Traditional*: Traditionally used and/or occupied by Musqueam people

*Ancestral*: Recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation

*Unceded*: Refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement

* Be short on this slide
* Traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of Coast Salish people, inckuding territories of :
  * Musqueam
  * Squamish

## Background Heart Transplant

- TODO

## Background Heart Rejection

- TODO

## Background types of rejection ...

## Background ACR vs Quilty

- TODO

## Background Types of data

- TODO

## Background In-house data

- Cite collaborators
- Or have their names and pic in here

## Background what method to apply

- Need to know which method is most suitable to apply on this
- Which there really isnt any after the pipeline run

## Objective

- Improve diagnosis using multimodal data

- Can we tell long term outcome of rejection?


## MESSI pipeline

## MESSI pipeline Input Processing

![](assets/img/overview_fig/overview_upper_panel.png){fig-align="center"}


- Currently handles both R and Python --> could extend to more
- Data flows in there ...
- Important model selection prior to evaluation


## MESSI pipeline Method Evaluation

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Each method is an isolated workflow (dash box)
- Each method internally runs evaluation in parallel
- Each result is saved separately ...
